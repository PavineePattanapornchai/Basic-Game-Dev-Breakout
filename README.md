# Basic-Game-Dev-Breakout
A reimagined version of the classic Breakout game with new features such as power-ups, including multi-ball and extra life, a moving dragon enemy, and a functional pause/resume menu. The game adds an element of randomness to power-up drops for a fresh challenge across levels.
